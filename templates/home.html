            <h2>About The Event</h2>
            <p>The 4th International Conference on Optoelectronic and Nanomaterials for Advanced Technology (icONMAT 2025) will be held at Cochin University of Science and Technology from February 11-14, 2025. This event marks the fourth in a series that was formerly known as OMTAT (Optoelectronic Materials and Thin Films for Advanced Technology). The first two conferences, OMTAT 2005 and OMTAT 2013, were held at Rivera Suites in Kochi, India, while the third, icONMAT 2019, took place at Cochin University of Science and Technology.
The conference aims to foster collaboration between academia and industry in nanomaterials, energy harvesting, energy storage and ultrafast laser technologies. It will provide a platform to showcase state-of-the-art techniques in synthesizing materials and designing nanostructures, heterostructures, and thin films for specific applications. These high-performance materials find uses in various applications, including gas sensors, photocatalysis, fuel cells, solar cells, optics, transparent electronics, and high-definition displays. The conference will delve into how factors such as process, architecture, size, and shape influence material performance for specific applications.
Remarkable progress has been made in the field of ultrafast phenomena, with the spectral range of ultrashort radiation pulses now extending to both long wavelengths like Terahertz radiation and short wavelengths such as soft and hard X-rays. This versatility enables applications in solar energy, molecular electronics, and optoelectronic devices. The use of chirped pulse amplified femtosecond lasers allows for exploring materials and processes at extreme light intensities and with unprecedented temporal resolution. Applications include secondary particle and radiation sources, transient probing, and laser material processing such as micromachining. Under the "ultrafast" theme, the conference will focus on THz to X-ray radiation sources, pump-probe (transient) systems, materials processing, and intense laser-matter interactions.
The event will bring together scientists and engineers involved in the fabrication, characterization, and modelling of optoelectronic materials and devices to discuss the latest developments in the field. It will serve as an excellent platform for exchanging ideas and insights on advancements in advanced materials and processing for future optoelectronic applications.</p>
